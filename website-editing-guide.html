<h1>A complete (WIP) guide to the website</h1>

<p>
	You're probably going to want to know how to log into the wordpress editor. This is pretty easy, just head over to the <a href="http://ramonaza.org/wp-login.php" target="_blank">login page</a>.
</p>

<p>
	Unless you're the Aleph Machshev, you are going to be using a generic username following the format: aleph_[position name]. For example, the Shaliach's username is "aleph_shaliach". Aleph Historian Shotare -> aleph_historian, Kohen Godol -> aleph_kohengodol.
</p>

<p>
	For your password, you will either need to contact the previous holder of the position, or the Machshev. The Machshev will either know your password, or will reset your password and tell you your new one.
</p>

<p>
	Once you're in, you'll be directed straight to the dashboard (see below). I'd recommend heading over to the "Profile" tab and personalizing your color scheme and other stuff.
</p>

<p>
	If you just came here to update your board page you can <a href="#board-pages">skip straight there</a>.

<h1 id="aleph-machshev">Aleph Machshev</h1>

<h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h2>

<p>
	The first thing an Aleph Machshev needs to do is to get his account. In order to do this, you need to chat with a previous Machshev (preferably the last one). Be friendly to them and kiss their asses, because no matter how much content is in this guide, the previous Machshev (and Google) will be your greatest assets.
</p>

<p>
	Once you get your account, you need to log in (this is covered in the <a href="#first-things-first">first things first section</a>.).
</p>

<p>
	The first image down below shows you a screen that should look similar to the first screen you see. The colors may be different, but you should be able to see a similar amount of items in the left navigation bar. If you see significantly fewer items, make sure the previous Machshev made you an Administrator.
</p>

<p>
	If you want to change the way things look for you, you can head to your profile, which you get to by going to Users -> Your Profile.
</p>

<p>
	At this point, I'd recommend looking around at all the tools, plugins, pages, etc, and try to get a feel of things yourself for a few minutes. Don't make changes in places you aren't certain about, because the website is kinda funky and can completely crash if you make changes in a sketchy area. (For the most part, avoid changing php templates unless you are 100% sure you know what you're doing.)

<h1 id="pages">Pages</h1>

<p>
	Our website is filled with pages. How do you view them, edit them, or add them?
</p>

<p>
	In the left navbar, head to Pages -> All Pages. Some notable pages: our front page (named "Events"), our phone list (named "Phone List" by Tom Bousso), board pages, cheers, etc.
</p>

<p>
	To add a new page, simply hit the "Add New" button on top, enter a title, and start adding content. If you know HTML, I'd consider making the page in "Text" mode, otherwise stick to "Visual" mode (the default one).
</p>

<p>
	It's definitely a good idea to look at other similarly formatted pages to the one you want to create, and mimic the format found in those pages.
</p>

<p>
	If you want the page to show up on the website, make sure to give it a "Parent" page (found in the right side of the editor, under "Page Attributes").
</p>

<p>
	I'd highly recommend always previewing your edits before publishing them, which can be done by hitting the "Preview" button found in the top-right of the page.
</p>

<p>
	If you want to make the page password protected (like this page), change the "Visibility" setting. Don't really worry about any of the options directly below the editor (e.g.: the "Readers" section).
</p>

<p>
	As soon as you publish, find your page online by following the permalink on the page (which you can always customize). Move the page to trash if it's no longer necessary.

<h2 id="changing-the-front-page">Changing the Front Page</h2>

<p>
	One of the most common requests the Machshevim get from random Alephs is to add things to or make changes to the front page. How do you do that?
</p>

<p>
	If you remember from the previous section, the front page is a page called "Events". The page editor is shown below.
</p>

<p>
	While this page may look simple, there are lessons to be learned here. First of all, you will see a red warning on top of the page. It's probably important. If you read it, you'll understand that where it says, "CONTENTS" in the page is where this thing called the "Event Manager" will place its content. It also gives a link to a settings page to change the way events look. Interesting.
</p>

<p>
	You might also notice that the spacing between the two lines on top looks pretty specific. And that the spacing between "CONTENTS" to the top two lines seems less than the spacing from "CONTENTS" to the bottom two lines.
</p>

<p>
	You might be inclined to immediately make the spacing the same and look nice. This serves as an <b>important reminder</b>: Always preview your changes before publishing them (or updating the page). What looks nice in the editor might look worse when live on the website.
</p>

<p>
	About the spacing between the first two lines, you can head over to the "Text" view (shown below) to see what's happening. Even if you're not fluent in HTML, you can notice that the first element is given a "font-size" of 25, but a "line-height" of 32. That explains why there seemed to be more space than usual between those two lines.
</p>

<p>
	Text view is something that for the most part, you can get by fine without touching it. However, there are going to be some pages that are going to mandate that you only edit them in the Text view, and then in the Text view they'll ask you to edit them in GitHub first. That's a story for another section.

<h2 id="making-a-page">Making a Page</h2>

<p>
	A pretty basic thing to do on any website is making pages, so how do you do that with wordpress?
</p>

<p>
	Luckily, a majority of that is already covered in the <a href="#pages">Pages section</a> of this guide, so head over there for more information.
</p>


<h1 id="events">Events</h1>

<p>
	You can get to the event section of the website easily enough, by heading to "Events" on the left navbar.
</p>

<p>
	This will lead you to a page containing a list of events. I've got good news for you though: unless you're making test events (that you should remember to delete) to test your style changes or whatnot, you won't need to go here.
</p>

<p>
	The Aleph S'gan also has access to this section, and he will be the one in charge of adding new events on a weekly basis, not you.
</p>

<p>
	In general, just respect the S'gan. If you want to make a change to event contents, be sure to ask the S'gan first. Don't go off editing events without telling the S'gan about it, that's just disrespectful.
</p>

<p>
	The page you'll be spending a lot more of your time on, is on the Event Settings page. You guessed it, you get to this page by heading to Events -> Settings.
</p>

<p>
	This page will be used to do anything from changing the style with which events are displayed on the front page (and their own event pages), adding new tags (like staff, house, food-loc), and more fun stuff.
</p>

<p>
	Spend a few minutes to explore all of these tabs if you haven't done so already, and then read on because some of this stuff gets confusing.

</p>

<h2 id="adding-users">Adding Users</h2>

<p>
	If you just finished your term as Aleph Machshev, and the new Machshev is expecting his own account so that he can play with the website himself, you're going to want to know how to do that.
</p>

<p>
	This is pretty easy though, you just need to head over to Users -> Add New, give them a username, some email account (they can change it themselves later), etc. <b>Important: </b>click on "Show Password". You will need to send them this temporary password for them to be able to log in. They can change this themselves if they want to.
</p>

<p>
	Last thing you need to do is set their Role to "Administrator" (if they're the new Machshev). If they are any other position but S'gan, set them to "Editor". If they are S'gan, set them to "Editor Plus Events" (because the S'gan also needs access to create/modify events).
</p>

<p>
	That's it, congratz!
