<h1 id="top">A complete guide to the website!</h1>


<p>
	Welcome to the complete guide to the website. This page will give you an accurate insight into the eyes of a Aleph Machshev, or anyone who needs to modify the website, be it Board Pages, or modifying Events as a S'gan.
</p>

<p>
	None of these individual sections are super long, so <b>always read the sections until the very end</b>, not just until you got something working. There might be something you're missing, and it would only take you a few moments to finish the section. If you leave the section only when you see immediate results, you might be in trouble when you try making changes to the same thing again.
</p>

<p>
	In addition, nearly <b>all of the sections are accompanied by pictures</b> in the bottom, so you can always scroll down to visually see what I'm describing.
</p>

<p>
	If any of this is too confusing, or if you want help doing something that isn't listed here, feel free to go down to the <a href="#help">help</a> section to see how to get advice.

<h1 id="first-things-first">First Things First</h1>

<p>
	You're probably going to want to know how to log into the wordpress editor. This is pretty easy, just head over to the <a href="/wp-login.php" target="_blank">login page</a>.
</p>

<p>
	Unless you're the Aleph Machshev, you are going to be using a generic username following the format: aleph_[position name]. For example, the Shaliach's username is "aleph_shaliach". Aleph Historian Shotare -> aleph_historian, Kohen Godol -> aleph_kohengodol.
</p>

<p>
	For your password, you will either need to contact the previous holder of the position, or the Machshev. If the Machshev doesn't know your password, direct him <a href="/website-editing-guide/website-editing-guide-protected-information/" target="_blank">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
	Once you're in, you'll be directed straight to the dashboard (see below). I'd recommend heading over to the "Profile" tab and personalizing your color scheme and other stuff.
</p>

<p>
	If you just came here to update your board page you can <a href="#board-pages">skip straight there</a>.
</p>

<h1 id="aleph-machshev">Aleph Machshev</h1>

<h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h2>

<p>
	The first thing an Aleph Machshev needs to do is to get his account. In order to do this, you need to chat with a previous Machshev (preferably the last one). Be friendly to them and kiss their asses, because no matter how much content is in this guide, the previous Machshev (and Google) will be your greatest assets.
</p>

<p>
	Once you get your account, you need to log in (this is covered in the <a href="#first-things-first">first things first section</a>.).
</p>

<p>
	The first image down below shows you a screen that should look similar to the first screen you see. The colors may be different, but you should be able to see a similar amount of items in the left navigation bar. If you see significantly fewer items, make sure the previous Machshev made you an Administrator.
</p>

<p>
	If you want to change the way things look for you, you can head to your profile, which you get to by going to Users -> Your Profile.
</p>

<p>
	At this point, I'd recommend looking around at all the tools, plugins, pages, etc, and try to get a feel of things yourself for a few minutes. Don't make changes in places you aren't certain about, because the website is kinda funky and can completely crash if you make changes in a sketchy area. (For the most part, avoid changing php templates unless you are 100% sure you know what you're doing.)
</p>

	</div>
</div>

<div class="clearfix"></div>


<h1 id="pages">Pages</h1>

<p>
	Our website is filled with pages. How do you view them, edit them, or add them?
</p>

<p>
	In the left navbar, head to Pages -> All Pages. Some notable pages: our front page (named "Events"), our phone list (named "Phone List" by Tom Bousso), board pages, cheers, etc.
</p>

<p>
	To add a new page, simply hit the "Add New" button on top, enter a title, and start adding content. If you know HTML, I'd consider making the page in "Text" mode, otherwise stick to "Visual" mode (the default one).
</p>

<p>
	It's definitely a good idea to look at other similarly formatted pages to the one you want to create, and mimic the format found in those pages.
</p>

<p>
	If you want the page to show up on the website, make sure to give it a "Parent" page (found in the right side of the editor, under "Page Attributes").
</p>

<p>
	I'd highly recommend always previewing your edits before publishing them, which can be done by hitting the "Preview" button found in the top-right of the page.
</p>

<p>
	If you want to make the page password protected (like this page), change the "Visibility" setting.
</p>

<p>
	By the way, below your editor, you'll see a few sections. The only important section here is the "Editors" section. For example, if you only want the Aleph S'gan to be able to edit a page, then check off the two boxes in "Editors", and then find the aleph_sgan in the list of eligible users. You shouldn't normally need to mess with this, however.
</p>

<p>
	As soon as you publish, find your page online by following the permalink on the page (which you can always customize). Move the page to trash if it's no longer necessary.
</p>

<p>
	By the way, if you want your page to show up in the menu of the main website, you'll have to do this manually. This is pretty simple, just head to Appearance -> Menus from the left navbar. By the way, this is probably the only section of Appearance you will ever need to change. From there, find your page in the left "Pages" menu, and add it to the menu. You'll find it in the bottom of the "Menu Structure", and from there you can just drag it to the correct position. Be sure to "Save Menu" when you're done.

<h2 id="changing-the-front-page">Changing the Front Page</h2>

<p>
	One of the most common requests the Machshevim get from random Alephs is to add things to or make changes to the front page. How do you do that?
</p>

<p>
	If you remember from the previous section, the front page is a page called "Events". The page editor is shown below.
</p>

<p>
	While this page may look simple, there are lessons to be learned here. First of all, you will see a red warning on top of the page. It's probably important. If you read it, you'll understand that where it says, "CONTENTS" in the page is where this thing called the "Event Manager" will place its content. It also gives a link to a settings page to change the way events look. Interesting.
</p>

<p>
	You might also notice that the spacing between the two lines on top looks pretty specific. And that the spacing between "CONTENTS" to the top two lines seems less than the spacing from "CONTENTS" to the bottom two lines.
</p>

<p>
	You might be inclined to immediately make the spacing the same and look nice. This serves as an <b>important reminder</b>: Always preview your changes before publishing them (or updating the page). What looks nice in the editor might look worse when live on the website.
</p>

<p>
	About the spacing between the first two lines, you can head over to the "Text" view (shown below) to see what's happening. Even if you're not fluent in HTML, you can notice that the first element is given a "font-size" of 25, but a "line-height" of 32. That explains why there seemed to be more space than usual between those two lines.
</p>

<p>
	Text view is something that for the most part, you can get by fine without touching it. However, there are going to be some pages that are going to mandate that you only edit them in the Text view, and then in the Text view they'll ask you to edit them in GitHub first. That's a story for another section.
</p>

<h2 id="making-a-page">Making a Page</h2>

<p>
	A pretty basic thing to do on any website is making pages, so how do you do that with wordpress?
</p>

<p>
	Luckily, a majority of that is already covered in the <a href="#pages">Pages section</a> of this guide, so head over there for more information.
</p>

<h2 id="github-pages">A Page wants me to Edit it in Text mode</h2>

<p>
	So you want to edit some page (maybe even this page), and it's asking you to edit it as text. You go over to the Text mode, and it's super confusing. What do you do?
</p>

<p>
	Well, hate to break it to you, but this stuff is pretty confusing. Don't fret though, I'll guide you through it all.
</p>

<p>
	First of all, if you head over to the Text mode, you'll see a comment with some form of an explanation. In that comment there's a link. Let's follow that link and see where it leads us (just copy paste it into the url of a new tab).
</p>

<p>
	Ooh, it seems to lead to some website containing the exact same content. That's promising. But how to edit it?
</p>

<p>
	Disclaimer: If you already know how to deal with GitHub and already have an account, I would just add your own account as a contributor to this repository, make your changes from there, and then copy paste your changes back into the wordpress editor in Text mode. In any case, you need to read a bit more to see how to get access to this content.
</p>

<p>
	Boy, it would be sweet if I had some account in this website to edit it. What's that? I already have one? Sweet! But really, head over to the "Sign in" link on the top right navbar.
</p>

<p>
	Now to log in, enter your username (ramonaza) and password. What's your password? Well, you can find out <a href="/website-editing-guide/website-editing-guide-protected-information/" target="_blank">here</a>. If the page looks blank, that probably means you're not an admin on the website, or you're not logged in.
</p>

<p>
	Note that the user interface of GitHub can change over time, so the following instructions might not be 100% accurate, but you should still be able to follow them, so do the best you can.
</p>

<p>
	Now that you're logged in, you will see some icons to the right of where it says "Raw", "Blame", and "History". Click on the first one (the pencil) to edit the file.
</p>

<p>
	At this point, you can edit the file in one of a thousand ways. Probably the simplest way for you would be to edit on github, copy paste the code to the page on the website, see the preview of that page, and keep making changes until you're satisfied. Okay, so now what do you do when you're done editing? How do you save your changes?
</p>

<p>
	If you scroll down, you'll see a section labeled: "Commit changes". Write a short message explaining the change you made. For most edits, you should also consider writing an extended description below. When you're done, git "Commit changes", and now it's official... on GitHub (please only do this when you finished making changes and you're sure they work).
</p>

<p>
	You're still going to want to publish your changes to the website, though. So after you commit, you're going to want to hit the "Raw" button on GitHub. This will show you the plain text of the file. Now you can just copy paste all of it (you can use ctrl + A to select everything) into the website Text mode editor. Update your changes, and you're done!
</p>

<p>
	Yippee!
</p>

<h1 id="events">Events</h1>

<p>
	You can get to the event section of the website easily enough, by heading to "Events" on the left navbar.
</p>

<p>
	This will lead you to a page containing a list of events. I've got good news for you though: unless you're making test events (that you should remember to delete) to test your style changes or whatnot, you won't need to go here.
</p>

<p>
	The Aleph S'gan also has access to this section, and he will be the one in charge of adding new events on a weekly basis, not you.
</p>

<p>
	In general, just respect the S'gan. If you want to make a change to event contents, be sure to ask the S'gan first. Don't go off editing events without telling the S'gan about it, that's just disrespectful.
</p>

<p>
	The page you'll be spending a lot more of your time on, is on the Event Settings page. You guessed it, you get to this page by heading to Events -> Settings.
</p>

<p>
	This page will be used to do anything from changing the style with which events are displayed on the front page (and their own event pages), adding new tags (like staff, house, food-loc), and more fun stuff.
</p>

<p>
	Spend a few minutes to explore all of these tabs if you haven't done so already, and then read on because some of this stuff gets confusing.

<h2 id="event-styles">Changing the Style for the Front Page Events</h2>

<p>
	What do you do if you want to change the way events are displayed in the home page? Well, you've come to the right place.
</p>

<p>
	First of all, you have to navigate to the right place. Head to the event settings page (mentioned in the last section). From there, go to the "Formatting" tab, and open up the "Events" section.
</p>

<p>
	The sections in "Default event list format header" and "Default event list format" should look familiar to you if you already read the <a href="#github-pages">A Page wants me to Edit it in Text mode</a> section. If you haven't already read it, read it fully now. You will need to follow its instructions in order to make changes to either of these two boxes.
</p>

<p>
	If you want to make changes to the style of the events, you'll want to edit the first box ("Default event list format header"). Be sure to edit in GitHub, and then copy your changes back. This sheet is written using "css". If you don't know how to use it, look up tutorials online for "css".
</p>

<p>
	If you want to change the layout, you'll want to edit the second box, labeled "Default event list format". Again, edit it on GitHub, and copy your changes back. This is written in HTML, find a quick tutorial online if this is new to you. In general though, this shouldn't be too hard to follow, and you should be able to make minor changes just fine.
</p>

<p>
	When you're done making changes on GitHub, be sure to "commit" your changes, and copy paste them back to the website. Then, click the "Save Changes (All)" button that you'll see if you scroll down a bit.
</p>

<p>
	Good Luck!

<h2 id="adding-event-attributes">Adding Event Attributes</h2>

<p>
	Okay, the S'gan wants you to add an event attribute, and you have no clue how to do that. By the way, an event attribute is a thing like: "desc", "food-loc", "bring", "planner", etc. that you see when adding events (see <a href="#adding-an-event">this section</a> for more information). So how is it done?
</p>

<p>
	Disclaimer: Please avoid doing this, as it messes with <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.ramonaza.androidzadikapplication">the app</a>, requiring it to take into account the new field ;( Only do the following if you really must.
</p>

<p>
	It's pretty simple. If you head to the events settings page, in the "General" tab, under "General Options", you will be able to see a text area labeled "Event Attributes". This probably looks like exactly what you want. Add a new field corresponding to what you want to add (following the format of the others).
</p>

<p>
	Afterwards, scroll down, and hit "Save Changes (All)". Now, head over to the "Formatting" tab, and open the "Events" section. You should go over the previous section first, or you're be very confused in the next few steps.
</p>

<p>
	In the second text block, labeled "Default event list format", follow the link in that top comment (starting with github.com). This will take you to the GitHub page with that code.
</p>

<p>
	To add your new attribute, you're probably going to want to copy one of those "div"'s, and modify it to fit your new attribute. For an example, view the third image below.
</p>

<p>
	At this point, before committing your changes, you should copy paste your code into the "Default event list format" text box in the Event Manager settings, scroll down, and hit "Save Changes (All)"
</p>

<p>
	To test if the code works, read the <a href="#adding-an-event">section explaining how to add an event</a>. If you follow those instructions, you should now see a new attribute show up. Fill in some test value for it. For the "When" section, be sure you put a date in the future, or the event won't show up on the website, and make sure the start time is before the end time.
</p>

<p>
	Hitting "Preview" wouldn't help, so just hit "Publish". When that's done, quickly go to the home page of ramon (<a href="ramonaza.org">ramonaza.org</a>) and check if it's working.
</p>

<p>
	If it works, great, delete your event as soon as possible (by moving it to trash), or change its visibility so that most people won't be able to see it. Keep reading on though!
</p>

<p>
	If you can't see any event, that means you probably didn't set the correct dates in the "When" section of the previous page. If you just can't see the new attribute, be sure you gave it some value in the add event page, and be sure that you copy pasted your new content from GitHub into the "Default event list format header" text area and saved your work.
</p>

<p>
	Now that it works, be sure to <b>make your "commit" on the GitHub page, so that your edit will be saved permanently</b>.
</p>

<p>
	You're done! Go tell the S'gan that he can start using his new attribute as soon as he wants, and he could even edit pre-existing events and add in the new attribute to them!

<h2 id="updating-the-gallery">Updating the Gallery (for a new event)</h2>

<p>
	Hey, you just had an event, and you want to add a gallery with all the images the Historian Shotare took for that event in the <a href="/gallery/" target="_blank">galleries page</a>. How do you do that?
</p>

<p>
	First of all, get all the pictures from the Historian Shotare. Once that's done, head to Photo Gallery -> Add Galleries/Images from the left navbar.
</p>

<p>
	Hit the "Add New" button near the top of the page. And now you can start adding galleries. However, we have a kind of precedent with galleries, that you should keep, so try following these instructions to the letter.
</p>

<p>
	As you would expect, give the gallery a name (generally the name of the event), and this time you can give is a short description if you want (but that is generally omitted). Now you need to add all the events to this gallery. For some reason, the "Add Images" button is not working for me currently, so I need to add images to the Media Library (by heading to "Media" in the top of the left navbar), and then use the "Import from Media Library" button. Then go ahead and save the gallery.
</p>

<p>
	Now, generate to Photo Gallery -> Generate Shortcode from the left navbar. Again, for precedence, you'll want to format the galleries the same as before, and to do that, follow these instructions precisely. Select "Image Browser" from the top options. Select that Gallery you just created in the Gallery: dropdown. Change the image width to 400 px (instead of 800). Select "No" on "Enable image title". Now you can click "Generate", and copy the "Shortcode" shown below.
</p>

<p>
	Now, find the "Gallery" page in Pages (made by Yonatan Wellingstein). Edit it, and be sure to go to "Text" mode. First of all, paste your "Shortcode" that you have from before, and then paste this code above it:
</p>

<p>
	&lt;h2 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #3366ff;&quot;&gt;Event Name!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
</p>

<p>
	Be sure to change the event name to your own name. Now preview your changes, and be sure you find your new gallery on top of the file, and that it's working. If it is, feel free to update the gallery. Yippee!
</p>

<h1 id="plugins">Plugins</h1>

<p>
	You may have noticed a Plugins section in the left navbar. Let's take a look at it (you can follow with the picture below if you aren't currently Machshev).
</p>

<p>
	The first thing you'll notice is that some plugins have the words "Activate", "Edit", and "Delete", while others are highlighted and contain the words "Deactivate" and "Edit", amongst others. As you may have guessed, the unhighlighted ones (starting with "Activate") are not yet activated, meaning that they're not currently being used, while the highlighted ones (starting with "Deactivate") <b>are</b> currently being used.
</p>

<p>
	You might be asking, why don't we just delete all the plugins that aren't being used? The answer is pretty complex. They might have once been used, but have since broken down, but the Machshev of the time thought to keep it there hoping that an update would eventually fix it. It might be something that a Machshev once wanted to implement but never got to it. Or it could simply be a Machshev asking the question, why remove it if it doesn't do any harm when deactivated?
</p>

<p>
	In any case, feel free to delete unused plugins, but understand that they don't harm anything. However, be sure to always deactivate a plugin, check thoroughly if anything breaks, and then delete. Never jump to just deleting, because that could cause a lot of damage.
</p>

<p>
	In order to understand more information about plugins, read on!
</p>

<div class="responsive r2">
	<div class="gallery">

<div class="clearfix"></div>


<h2 id="plugins-overview">Plugins Overview</h2>

<p>
	Woah, there are a lot of plugins, and you might not be sure what they all do. Before you go off deleting all of them, take a few minutes to be informed to be sure you don't go breaking anything bad.
</p>

<p>
	Before we start, don't delete the "Events Manager" plugin, or the "Role Scoper" plugin. Deleting any of these two plugins will cause havoc, and break a lot of infrastructure we have in place. You might not see their effects at first, but if you look at what they do you'll be sure to find it. Also, never delete any activated plugin relating to galleries. These plugins store a lot of our media, meaning that if you remove them, you would potentially lose a lost of that chapter's history.
</p>

<p>
	Now let's look at all the useful plugins and what they do:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		<b>Better WordPress reCAPTCHA:</b>

		This plugin is being used to prevent a bot from creating a bunch of fake users for the website by adding a captcha to the registration page. This happened to us once, and never happened to us since this extension.
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Capability Manager Enhanced:</b>

		This plugin was used to create the S'gan's unique "Editor Plus Events" role (which allows the S'gan to edit its own pages and manage events, which is integral for the S'gan). Deleting the plugin won't remove or change the existing role, but would make it harder to modify it in the future.
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Custom 404 Pro:</b>

		We have a custom 404 page (which you see when going to a page that doesn't exist). That page is possible with this plugin (otherwise it would be a generic 404 page).
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Easy Timer:</b>

		I'm not entirely sure where this is used. We probably had a countdown timer at some point. This plugin is probably a good plugin to make that happen.
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Edan is sexy:</b>

		This plugin is renamed from "Pit Login Welcome". It's supposed to make a friendly welcome message for users when they log in.
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Events Manager:</b>

		Don't remove! This plugin handles all our event functionality that the S'gan constantly uses. This plugin is also super nice in the way that it allows us to create an RSS feed that <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.ramonaza.androidzadikapplication" target="_blank">our app</a> can communicate with!
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Facebook:</b>

		Integrates posts with Facebook. Seems interesting, don't remember anyone ever using it, but hell, you can change that.
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>One of the Galleries:</b>

		We have a few activated galleries, and they're all being used somewhere on the website. They also all suck, so if you find a better one, get the Historian Shotare to start using it. However, <b>never remove them</b> because they also store a bunch of the images&mdash;we would lose a ton of images if you remove any of these plugins.
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Meta Slider:</b>

		Adds picture slideshows in your posts.
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Raw HTML:</b>

		Allows some post to contain pure HTML in the Text editor without wordpress messing it up (it would still mess the post up if you try editing it in the visual mode).
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Restrict Content:</b>

		There is a page that contains information only for Administrators (passwords and stuff) that we don't want anyone else to be able to see. This plugin allows that. Without this plugin, that content becomes public.
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Role Scoper:</b>

		Allows easy modification of roles, and easy creation of new rules to give to users. This is used for the S'gan's role, as mentioned above. If you notice that the Editor Plus Events role weirdly has access to "activate plugins", that's not a bug. Without this access, S'ganim would not be able to modify or see event locations after making them for some weird reason.
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>RSVP:</b>

		This plugin was once used to try to get an RSVP system working. I don't think we ever got it to work. You could try if you want.
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>TinyMCE Advanced:</b>

		Adds a lot of nice features for the visual editor (in pages and such). This is pretty useful for people who use the visual editor, as some things are very annoying to do without this plugin.
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>WP Simple Pay (Lite Version):</b>

		We tried getting a donate button on the website. I'm not sure if that worked. It might have, I never saw it though.
	</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="updating-plugins">Updating Plugins</h2>

<p>
	Sooner or later, you're bound to get some little icons close to the next navbar indicating that some plugins have updates available. This isn't really that scary, don't freak out. You just have to know how to deal with it.
</p>

<p>
	There are really 2 ways. The first way, and probably easiest way, is just to never update them. And to be honest, there might never be a need to. However, sometimes updates contain fixes for bugs, or new features, and you might just want to always keep your plugins up to date. How do you do that?
</p>

<p>
	There are really two ways to update plugins, and they're both essentially the same. The first is by just going to the plugins page from the left navbar (Plugins -> Installed Plugins). From here, you can find the plugins that contain updates. If the plugin isn't activated (it shows "Activate" under it instead of "Deactivate"), then updating it is pretty pointless, but also can't hurt anything. If if it's an activated plugin, meaning that it's probably in use, then it might be worthwhile to hit the "View version [version #] details" before updating in order to make sure it isn't going to ruin anything.
</p>

<p>
	Once you're essentially satisfied with the change, you can update the plugin, or you can choose not to.
</p>

<p>
	The second way to update plugins, is by hitting the little circular arrow button (<span class="f463"></span>) on the top navbar. From there you can just see a list of plugins, and it is much easier to update them from here. However, in this page you can't see which of them are currently being used and which aren't.
</p>

<p>
	I'd 100% recommend trying to use the website right after updating, especially if you didn't look at all the changelogs. If you broke something, you want to find out as soon as possible. What do you do if you just broke something? You can find out <a href="#plugin-breaks-things">here</a>.

<h2 id="plugin-broke">I Updated Plugins and Something Broke</h2>

<p>
	So maybe you didn't go over the changelog of all the plugins, and now something broke when you updated them. What do you do?
</p>

<p>
	Go through the plugins you updated one by one, and if they are activated, try deactivating them. With one of the plugins, doing this should fix whatever was broken.
</p>

<p>
	Now, if that plugin is a very important plugin, that's not good, so try looking up online, researching, getting help from Dan Appleman, do whatever you can to fix the issue. </p>
<p>
	If it's not really that important of a plugin, you can just leave it deactivated, fix anything that relied on it, and then go on with your day.
</p>

<p>
	Good luck!
</p>


<h2 id="adding-users">Adding Users</h2>

<p>
	If you just finished your term as Aleph Machshev, and the new Machshev is expecting his own account so that he can play with the website himself, you're going to want to know how to do that.
</p>

<p>
	This is pretty easy though, you just need to head over to Users -> Add New, give them a username, some email account (they can change it themselves later), etc. <b>Important: </b>click on "Show Password". You will need to send them this temporary password for them to be able to log in. They can change this themselves if they want to.
</p>

<p>
	Last thing you need to do is set their Role to "Administrator" (if they're the new Machshev). If they are any other position but S'gan, set them to "Editor". If they are S'gan, set them to "Editor Plus Events" (because the S'gan also needs access to create/modify events).
</p>

<p>
	That's it, congratz!

<h2 id="removing-users">Removing Users</h2>

<p>
	In this section, I'm not going to teach you how to remove users, as that should be self explanatory if you already got to this point in the guide. However, please read on.
</p>

<p>
	If you look at the user list, you will see a list of users associated with board positions, but even more users who are Administrators, many of whom you've probably never heard of. And you may consider removing them. Here's why you shouldn't.
</p>

<p>
	As you may have guessed, these past Administrators that you see were Machshevim at some point, just like you. In a normal company, employees usually stick around long enough to pass on all their knowledge. In Ramon, a lot of these Machshevim make a lot of changes, and then when 6 months pass, they're out.
</p>

<p>
	What does this mean? When you edit pages, tools, etc., it will tell you who originally made that page, wrote that tool, or anything. If you're confused about something, the absolute best source of help is the original writer of that tool. I would constantly email or facebook message people who I saw who created specific things, and they'd just hop on and help me with whatever it is I requested. This was infinitely valuable.
</p>

<p>
	Removing these users, removes your greatest support system.
</p>

<p>
	And when you leave, be certain that the next Machshev is going to want your help, and perhaps the next Machshev, or some Machshev editing your content years later. These things happen.
</p>

<p>
	Furthermore, there are some pretty cool people over there (and pretty smart). You guys might not know this, but the creator of the website is the now-alumnus Tom Bousso, and guess what, his account is still on the website. That's pretty sick!
</p>

<p>
	I'm releasing this guide as an alumnus myself, as a member of the last class who was there when the new website was created. There's a lot of history there, and I think it's awesome.
</p>

<p>
	Anyway, I hope that makes sense to you. Of course feel free to delete an account if someone made it by accident or anything, just think twice about deleting a user (or removing a plugin for that matter) if it's not causing any harm.
</p>

<p>
	Thanks for reading!
</p>


<h1 id="aleph-sgan">Aleph S'gan</h1>

<p>
	Hello Aleph S'gan! You officially have access to more things on the website than every other officer but the Machshev. Yes, you have access to more things than even the Godol!
</p>

<p>
	After you <a href="#board-pages">update your board page</a>, you're going to be spending a majority of your time in the "Events" plugin on the left navbar. Go ahead and go to it, and you'll see a list of events.
</p>

<p>
	For the events section, I'd actually recommend chatting it over with the previous S'gan before running wild and trying things out yourself, because things can be pretty finicky. It would be hard to know what sections to fill out and which to avoid.
</p>

<p>
	Luckily, this guide also covers all that, so be sure to continue reading below!

<h2 id="adding-an-event">Adding an Event</h2>

<p>
	From the event page I had previously shown you how to get to, click on the "Add Event" button.
</p>

<p>
	From here, things need to be done in a specific way. The name of the event will go in the title section, where it says "Enter title here".
</p>

<p>
	For the location, enter it in "Location Name". First try searching for the location by name, e.g.: Ofek's Home, SPHDS (pick one with the address), Palo Alto JCC. Note that once you pick a location, you need to click the blue link right under it if you want to pick a new location. If you location doesn't already exist, then add a new location by going to Events -> Locations. You can see some more details on this in my <a href="#adding-a-location">adding a location</a> section.
</p>

<p>
	Note that nothing you put in the first big editor box, or the "Excerpt" box will actually do anything, so leave them blank. The place you care about is the "Attributes" section down below.
</p>

<p>
	The most important attributes that you should always fill out are: "desc" -> the event description given to you by the planners, "bring" -> a list of items to bring (could be: money for food), and "planner" -> who planned the event (could be an Aleph name, or "The Chapter", or something else).
</p>

<p>
	The other attributes aren't mandatory, so if you don't know them yet, you don't need to know them in order to publish the event. However, once you find them out, they're nice to have (parents bug the Metaksher about these things all the time). You can always edit this event after publishing it, add a few attributes, and then update the page.
</p>

<p>
	For the images by the way, just enter the url of the image you want to add.
</p>

<p>
	<b>Final important step.</b> Hold your horses, don't go publishing this event yet. Be sure to first update the "When" section in the top-right of the page. Unless it's an overnight or convention, the "From" and "to" should both be the same day. After that, fill in the start and end times.
</p>

<p>
	When you're done with that, go ahead and hit the "Preview" button. You'll notice that it doesn't redirect you to the front page, it redirects you to that specific event's page. If you didn't know each page has its own page, now you do XD. Anyways, you should be able to verify at least some of your details from this page, but not all of them. For example, in the example shown below, the planner isn't showing up.
</p>

<p>
	When you're done with that, hit "Publish", and be ready to check the Ramon front page to see if you didn't mess up. If you did, don't fret, just update the event page and make changes, if you catch your mistakes, nobody would ever know.
</p>

<p>
	As you can see below in the last image, the event was successfully created, and it's showing who its planned by! If your event doesn't show up, be sure you didn't create it in the past. Also sometimes events might not show if they're in the same day, so don't freak out if that happens.
</p>

<p>
	What do you do when the event has expired, and you want to take it off the website. Check the website. The event is already gone. You should never have to delete past events, they should stop showing up on the front page of the website all by themselves. Yes, this means that if you do a good job of adding all the events, the history of all the events during your term will be preserved. I wish this existed when I was a new Aleph, I could find out the date of my first event ;'(.

<h2 id="adding-a-location">Adding a Location</h2>

<p>
	You're making a new event, but you can't find a location that you need. How do you make a new location? Or what if someone moved homes, and you have to update their address?
</p>

<p>
	Luckily, this is a very simple task. Using the left navbar, simply head to Events -> Locations. Then click on the "Add Location" button on top. If instead you just want to change a location, then you can search for the locations in the top right.
</p>

<p>
	This is pretty simple. Write the name of the location on top, where it says "Enter title here". Then, enter in as much information about the location in the "Where" section as you want. Just like in the events page, you can leave the main editor blank, as it won't be used. When you're done, you can just publish the event, and start using it in your events!
</p>

<p>
	Editing an event can be done similarly, just by finding the location, editing it, and then Updating the location when you're done.

<h2 id="adding-event-attributes-sgan">Adding Event Attributes (For the S'gan)</h2>

<p>
	You're the S'gan, and you want to add an attribute to the events (like "desc", "food-loc", "planners", etc.) that doesn't already exist. How do you do that?
</p>

<p>
	The short answer is: Please don't, it breaks stuff with our app.
</p>

<p>
	If you aren't taking no for an answer (I eternally hate you for this), then there's another equally short answer: Good news, you don't have to do that yourself, get the Machshev to do it for you! Politely ask the Machshev to add your new event attribute, and direct him to this guide (it contains detailed instructions for the Machshev on how to add a new attribute).
</p>

<p>
	Please, don't rush this. Understand that adding a new attribute is a very tough task for the Machshev, and requires him changing things in many locations, and having them all work together. This could take the Machshev a long time, so be supportive, and understand that they might fail.
</p>

<p>
	Anyway, nice talk.
</p>



<h1 id="board-pages">Board Pages</h1>

<p>
	So the Aleph Machshev is bugging you to update your board page. How do you do that?
</p>

<p>
	First of all, be sure to follow the instructions on the <a href="#first-things-first">first things first</a> section if you haven't already.
</p>

<p>
	Now I'm assuming you're already logged in, and are at your Dashboard, or some random page.
</p>

<p>
	You're going to want to find your board page. To do this, from the left navbar go to Pages -> All Pages. Unlike what happens when the Machshev does this, you should only see a few pages. You guessed it, these pages were made by (or for) previous people with your position.
</p>

<p>
	To edit your board page, you're going to want to edit the one which says "Parent Page: Board Pages" on it. Make your changes to the page, and then hit the "Preview Changes" button on the top-right to be sure it looks nice. Once you're satisfied with your changes, hit the "Update" button, and your board page on the website should be instantly updated.
</p>

<p>
	What if you want to edit some of the other pages you have access to? I'd consult the previous holders of your board position to ask about that, and I'd also definitely check out the <a href="#pages">Pages</a> section of this guide.

<h1 id="help">Help</h1>

<p>
	If you're a normal, sane Aleph, reading this guide, and you get confused somewhere, or something isn't working for you, try getting help.
</p>

<p>
	If getting help from previous Machshevim and Dan Appleman doesn't work, then you can always get help from me: <a href="mailto:ofek@theofekfoundation.org">ofek@theofekfoundation.org</a>. Alternatively you can find me on facebook, I'm Ofek Gila.
</p>

<p>
	Feel free to contact me in general if you think I'm missing something, you want me to add a section, etc. I'm here for you. Good Luck!
